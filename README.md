## Brief Description:
We plan to recreate the original 1978 Space Invaders arcade cabinet shooter game in Processing. We want to implement as many features of the Space Invaders and try to replicate the game as much as possible. The Space Invaders game is a shooting game where the player controls a horizontal laser and attempts to survive the onslaught of invaders. The game keeps going until the player fails in resisting the wave or dies.
